    "1. Don't be arfraid to launch a product without ML (start with basic heuristics). Heuristic is a quick solution to the problem. \n",
    "2. First, design and implement metrics. \n",
    "3. Choose ML model over the complex heuristics\n",
    "4. Focus on infrastructure and make the first model as simple as possible\n",
    "5. Test the infrastructure independently of ML\n",
    "6. Be careful when copying pipelines (pipelines usually strondly depend on the specific task\n",
    "7. Turn heuristics into features or handle them externally. Even if ML is already implemented, heuristics can give a lift. \n",
    "8. Know the freshment requirement of your system (how often the model should be updated). \n",
    "9. Detect problems before exporting the models (check for AUC for example).\n",
    "10. Watch for silent failures.\n",
    "11. Give feature columns owners and documentation (even if columns have descriptive names, it is good to have.\n",
    "12. Don't overthink which objective you choose to directly optimize (keep it simple and don't think too hard about balancing different metrics, they will all go up if ML done properly).\n",
    "13. Choose a simple, observable and attributable metric for your first objective (The ML objective should be something that is easy to measure and is a proxy for the \"true\" objective).\n",
    "14. Starting with interpretable model makes debugging easier (linear regression, logistic regression, poisson regression are directly motivated by probabilistic model).\n",
    "15. Separate spam filtering and quality ranking in a police layer. \n",
    "16. Plan to launch and iterate (complexity slows down the update cycle).\n",
    "17. Start with directly observed and repoted features as apposed to learned features. Learned features are generated by external systems (neural nets or clustering). \n",
    "18. Explore with features of content that generalize across contexts. \n",
    "19. Use very specific features when you can. \n",
    "20. Combine and modify existing features to create new features in human-understandable ways. The two most standard approaches are \"**discretizations**\" and \"**crosses**. Discretization consists of taking a continuous feature and creating many discrete features from it. Donâ€™t overthink the boundaries of these histograms: basic quantiles will give you most of the impact. Crosses combine two or more feature columns.\n"
