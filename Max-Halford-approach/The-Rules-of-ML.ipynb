    "3. Choose ML model over the complex heuristics\n",
    "4. Focus on infrastructure and make the first model as simple as possible\n",
    "5. Test the infrastructure independently of ML\n",
    "6. Be careful when copying pipelines (pipelines usually strondly depend on the specific task\n",
    "7. Turn heuristics into features or handle them externally. Even if ML is already implemented, heuristics can give a lift. \n",
