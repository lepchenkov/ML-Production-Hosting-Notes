Sumit Kumar 2017 Pydata Seattle talk

Bringing intelligence to where the data lives. 

The old approach is to separate the database and application/intelligence.
The new approach is to separate application and intelligence/database.

Old approach: we pull data from the database and bulid python-based model. 
And the model sits in the application. And there are issues with it. 

And the new paradigm it to move the intelligence and the models right where
the data is. And this model becomes the asset of the enterprise. And any 
number of applications can get access to this intelligence by connecting 
to this databse.
